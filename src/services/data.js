We discovered the world of “travel hacking” & became obsessed.  So after 2 years of saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a “one year” trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we rean out of money and went home to normal life. We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time. Van life was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 \n\n#travel #travelvlog #vanlife\n\n0:00 Nate has a mustache\n0:27 Why we’re making this video\n1:12 Marriage problems?\n1:45 Our 2021 recap\n2:46 Where we’ve been - the backstory\n5:41 Our identity crisis\n6:50 getting sentimental💗\n7:52 How we decide what to do\n9:12 Our 2022 plans!\n10:39 Where is the van?!\n14:50 Our passion project\n15:48 We love you",

In the end,\nI’ll always be your friend.\n\nWell done superstar,\nShine a light, we’re fighting the dark.\nWell done superstar!\nIt’s my grand design,\nI’ll never ever leave you behind.\nIt’s my grand design!",

        "description": "10 Godzilla Caught On Camera & Spotted In Real Life!\n\r\nIf you're new, Subscribe! → http://goo.gl/djmfuX\r\n\r\nFact File is the #1 place for all your heart warming stories about amazing people that will inspire you everyday. Make sure to subscribe and never miss a single video!\r\n\r\n#viral #amazing #FactFile #animals\n\n\nA Godzilla is a giant creature; the size of a high rise building that is believed to be the offspring of a gorilla and a whale; evident in their adaptation to living on land and water alike. It is a giant bipedal, almost indestructible creature possessing special powers and is believed to have retreated deep underwater after the Cretaceous extinction. And the existence of these huge creatures have been something of a debate for a long time. So, in this video, we’ll be taking you through 10 times Godzilla was caught on camera and spotted in real life.\nWithout any further ado, let’s begin. \n10. Godzilla gator in Florida \nFor residents of Florida, seeing a large alligator is frequent and almost normal. However, in 2017, the video of a dinosaur-sized alligator surfaced on the internet. This breathtaking size of this creature has simply taken social media aback seeing how big it was, spanning up to 15 feet in length and 800 lbs. in weight. The video of the Godzilla alligator on a casual stroll across the lush green vegetation was taken at Polics Nature Discovery center around Lakeland in Florida. \nAccording to the Buffalo creek general manager, Ryan Henderson, he claimed that the Godzilla sized alligator had been out there for over 25 years. Incredible!\nThis clip is a perfect description of Godzilla adaptations to live on land and in water. This creature has established an ecosystem in the area and does not seem to hurt anybody within its immediate proximity. The giant alligator is also a subtle reminder that Godzilla may not be extinct after all; just a reduced population.\n\n9. Baby Godzilla in water. Galapagos Islands. 2016\nIn the video that has been circulating since 2016, a marine iguana was captured on video and has been the center of discussion as regards the origin of Godzilla. The massive 8-foot baby creature has been popularly described as a “baby Godzilla” because it is the only undersea lizard and has an uncanny resemblance to the iconic monster. Steve Winkworth was the diver who captured the moment on camera while diving to the rocky depths of the ocean off the Galapagos Islands and this has been a wonderful revelation for Scientists.\nIts rampaging movements and incredible size make it jaw-dropping and it is the only existing species of Iguana that lives on land but finds its food like algae and seaweed in the ocean. Although in water, it can dive up to 9 meters deep with its arms by its sides and also comes up to the surface for air repeatedly, it’s probably another pointer for the birth and adaptation of Godzilla as seen on camera.\n\n8. Godzilla in Barbados \nAlthough Godzilla has incredible size, many of the videos in which it is featured are not usually clear; and this rare sighting off the coasts of Barbados is not any better. The video shows a moonlit night over water with what appears to be Godzilla, emerging from the water. Legends say Godzilla is adapted to living on land and foraging for food in water and although the video is super creepy, the emergence of the creature from water revealed a splitting image of what looked like the actual snapshot of Godzilla captured on camera.\nMany times, the clouds and fog paint optical illusions to us humans and look like creatures we already know. However, this sighting was spectacular and surreal; reminding us that we may not be alone on this planet, Earth\n\n7. Godzilla fossil. Argentina. 2005 \nBy finding fossils, it is a pointer of how long something existed and it gives us indications for present possibilities. That said, the fossil of Godzilla was discovered in Argentina in 2005.\nThe newly discovered fossil according to the national geographic channel had to be virtually complete and possessed strong ties with the crocodile but is an even stranger sea monster, resembling a long-necked Titanosaur. The 80cm long fossil which was approximately 12 feet long had the petrifying skull of a predatory dinosaur that lurked along the Pacific Ocean well around 135 million years ago and was found almost completely intact\nIt took years of work for researchers to uncover the entire skeleton and Paleontologists claim that Godzilla has strong jaws with serrated teeth that gave it the ability to grip. In an interview with National Post, the scientist was quoted saying “Given the length and magnitude this animal will bring along when it’s reconstructed, there won’t be a building that can contain it” You heard that right! Evolutionary trends also show that the fossil in its life form would raze down a large geographical area in one stomp. Luckily, that was in the Jurassic era.",

        "description": "Description:\n\nI don’t know about you but I find statues kind of creepy; I always feel like they are watching me! Statues often depict notable humans or divine beings, which already gives them a sense of being kinda otherworldly. In today’s video, we are talking about 10 Mysterious Statues Caught Moving on Camera. A question for you: what would you do if you saw a statue move?! Considering I find the Weeping Angels from Doctor Who just about the scariest fictional monsters of all time, I think I would just close my eyes and cry! Let me know what you would do in the comments\n\nFor Copyright Issues, Please Feel Free to E-mail me: \nTSindustries32@hotmail.com",

        "description": "If These Moments Were Not Filmed, No One Would Believe It!\n\nIf you're new, Subscribe! → http://goo.gl/djmfuX\n\nTop 5 Best is the #1 place for all your heart warming stories about amazing people that will inspire you everyday. Make sure to subscribe and never miss a single video!\n\n#viralstory #amazingpeople #top5best\n\n\nIf These Moments Were Not Filmed, No One Would Believe It!\n\nGood thing that we all have access to cameras these days! Otherwise, a lot of people wouldn’t believe a lot of things that happen around us. Whether it’s a gopro, a professional video camcorder or just your phone camera, now you have a lot of options to document your everyday life and have proof of any extraordinary things that might happen around you. Today we’ll be looking at “things that you wouldn’t believe if they hadn’t been filmed.” We’ll go through a lot of fun and exciting videos of things that you don’t get to see everyday, but that they definitely happened and there are videos to prove it. Once you’re done watching this video, you will want to go out and keep your camera ready to record any cool events that might come your way!\n\n\nThe Lucky Fisherman\n\n\nWhen this guy finally caught something on his net, he started to pull it back up. At first, it all seems like a regular catch. He pulls out one fish. Then, another one comes out, and then...another one until finally, he has a net so full that he almost loses his balance. At the end, there were so many fish inside the net that he had a hard time pulling the whole thing back up. But it seems like things ended well for this guy as he came back to the shore and the crowd cheered for his extraordinary accomplishment.\n\nDog Fight\n\n\nDog fights are quite common, but the one right here is very funny. It all happened while the police were trying to negotiate with an armed robbery suspect when suddenly, a small pug in the neighborhood picked a fight with the police dog at the scene. The pug is certainly little, but it’s not afraid to come face to face with the fierce and well trained police dog. Finally, the pug exits the scene and you can even see that some members of the police force followed him to make sure that he didn’t come back to mess with their canine friend. \n\nNaughty Monkey\n\n\nAlright the next video might be slightly disturbing, but before you watch it, I just want you to know ...the kid on this video is alright! He just suffered a few scratches. But what happened is that a monkey snatched a toddler off his bench and dragged him away. The innocent child was just hanging out with other kids when out of the sudden, this naughty monkey jumped on the kid and grabbed him. I wouldn’t like being that kid! And I’m sure the poor boy will want to stay away from monkeys from now on. The monkey on this video is part of a street performance group, which is a very popular thing on the streets of Indonesia, which is where this video was taken. It sounds like the kind of monkey no one would want to mess with.\n\n\nThe Friendly Beluga Whale\n\n\nThere are naughty animals, but there are other ones who are friendly and very helpful, like the beluga whale on this video. There was a woman watching the beluga whale when suddenly, she dropped her phone. Now, in this kind of event, you wouldn’t expect an animal to respond to this kind of call for help. However, the beluga whale dove in and grabbed the woman’s phone to bring it back to surface and return it to its owner. See? Not all animals out there are naughty, there are some helpful ones too.\n\nThe Tank Crash\n\n\nYou don’t really see tanks on the streets everyday, unless there’s something pretty serious happening in your city. So, when you spot one,   since they’re not an everyday sight, you’re likely to pull out your phone and record. Like the people behind this video in Minsk, who pulled out their phones to record this impressive tank moving along the streets of the Belarusian capital. And I’m glad they were recording, otherwise we wouldn’t believe what happened next! The tank skidded and crashed on a traffic light in an epic way. Was he going too fast? Maybe. Other tanks passed him by afterwards and none of them had the same unlucky fate as this one.\n\nThe Survivor\n\n\nI hear a lot about near death experiences, but I rarely get to watch videos of the moments when these people actually came face to face with death - like this man in China who was standing in traffic when out of the sudden, a huge construction crane smashes his car. By looking at the video, you could easily think that the guy was not meant to survive - but he did! A few seconds after the incident, you can see him jump out of the car. He was scared, that’s for sure. But I’m glad he’s alive to tell the story.\n\n\nThe Pine that was Struck by Lightning\n\nI really don’t get why the people behind this video set up the camera the way they did, but it seems like they knew that something epic was about to happen.",

Today, we feel that we understand\nalmost every phenomenon happening under it, but there are still some that leaves us to question\neverything that we know. Today, we will be looking at 10 unexplainable mysteries captured in heaven.\nNumber one may be the first documented sightings of UFOs so stay tuned for that.\n\nNumber 10. The Taos Hum\nSome of the greatest mysteries in the heavens cannot be seen, but rather heard. That statement\ncouldn’t be more true for the first heavenly mystery on our list.\nSome residents and visitors in the small city of Taos, New Mexico, have for years been quite annoyed\nand, not to mention, extremely puzzled by a mysterious and faint low-frequency hum in the desert air.\nTo further add to the mystery, only about 2 percent of Taos residents report hearing the sound. Some\nbelieve it is caused by unusual acoustics, but that doesn’t explain the selective nature of the\nphenomenon; others suspect mass hysteria or some secret, sinister purpose, the latter being the\nfavored explanation by conspiracy theories worldwide.\nWhether described as a whir, hum, or buzz and whether psychological, natural, or supernatural no one\nhas yet been able to locate the sound&#39;s origin. Thing is, a survey revealed that those who claim to hear\nthe sounds actually hear many different sounds, suggesting the experiences may be subjective, not\nactually objective sounds.\n\nNumber 9. The Evil Cloud\nPakistan residents were left bemused as a black O-shaped cloud was spotted over a city. The\nphenomenon was seen floating over Lahore sometime mid-January of this year and was dubbed the\n“evil cloud” by some. Once the footage was posted to social media a slew of theories of the\nphenomenon were suggested.\nMost people shrugged it off as just natural phenomenon, even posting amusing comments on social\nmedia. One quite amusing post reads “Aliens only land in America, and another joked that too many\nPakistani people were vaping at the same time. But, some people took the phenomenon seriously, citing\nvarious ominous explanations including, of course, the beginnings of an alien invasion.\nAfter the video was posted, others uploaded photos of what seemed to be like similar phenomena, this\ntime happening in Dubai. But what exactly are those black rings of smoke?\nA plausible explanation would be they are smoke remnants of a tiny explosion which is formed the same\nway when smokers and vapors produce smoke rings. The thing is, no explosions were heard prior to the\nsightings, leaving the black rings completely unexplainable.\n\nNumber 8. Cities in the Sky\n\nPeople have been seeing weird things in the sky since the first day they decided to look up and record\nwhat they see. Most of these mysterious objects are now science fact. But then, something totally\nunexplainable appears out of nowhere, making us question everything we know about the universe up\nuntil now.\nOn April 21, 2017, in Jieyang, China, numerous citizens were awestruck by the image of a city floating on\nthe clouds above them. Many took to the Internet to post pictures and just generally freak out, but\nthere was really no cause for concern as it has happened before.\nThe same floating cities were recorded at five different locations in China in just over six years prior to\nthis event. This number of events has led theorists to hypothesize various possibilities: aliens are\nattempting to cross over from a different dimension, the second coming of Christ is here, or the images\nare a holographic test by the Chinese government or maybe even the US government.\nMost of these explanations are pure speculation, but there is a possible explanation: a rare weather\nevent known as Fata Morgana, where light passing through heat waves causes a duplication effect. This\nwould be an acceptable explanation if the images in the sky were not completely different from the\nskyline below them.\n\nNumber 7. The Bloody Sky\nIf there is one thing that most world religions have in common is that their gods or deities have always\nbeen associated with the sky. For centuries, people have looked up searching for answers and guidance,\nand sometimes warnings of foreboding things that are yet to come. In the predominantly",

Once you’re done watching this video, you will want to go out with a gopro and see if you can catch some interesting and perhaps, creepy footage.\n\nThe Underwater Car\n(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWDVko2sRMQ)\n\nWhen teenager Max Werenka went to explore Griffin Lake in Canada, he spotted a strange rectangular object while being on his paddle board. After having a closer look, he realized it was a car. Everyone in the area thought it was a car that had not been removed after a terrible accident in 2009. However, when an officer came to the area for a picnic, he admitted that the car from 2009 had definitely been removed back then. The water was a bit murky and it didn’t allow the officer to spot the car, so Max went down and recorded everything with his gopro. The car was finally removed and soon enough, they found out that the car belonged to Janet Farris, a 70 year old woman who went missing back in 1992. She disappeared on the way to her niece’s wedding and her family never heard back from her again. Surely, it was relieving to the family to finally learn what had happened to this lady, even though they had already given up hope. \n\nBigfoot in the Forest\n\n(https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3745746/Was-Bigfoot-just-spotted-Oregon-Dog-GoPro-strapped-stumbled-bizarre-creature-forest.html)\n\nYou can strap a GoPro on different parts of your body, but you can also strap it to your dog’s body to sort of get a perspective from their point of view. I don’t know about you and your pets, but a lot of people like to do that. Thanks to that, a guy in Oregon was able to find some shocking footage that a lot of people claim to be a sight of Bigfoot. The guy and his dog went for their regular walk into the forest when they came across this strange figure that was standing like a human, but was very hairy and had the appearance of an ape. When the video went viral, a lot of people started to assume that it was definitely Bigfoot. Others, however, questioned the authenticity of the clip due to the dog’s reaction - the dog didn’t seem shocked or scared at all. So we can assume this dog is either very comfortable with Bigfoot around or the whole thing was set up. One thing is for sure...this is a creepy sight! \nTrainspotting\n(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-yV9bzx7WQ number 5)\n\nYoutuber Brian Garcia and his friends were hanging out, when they found themselves in an experience that brought them very close to their deaths. It all happened around the train tracks in a neighborhood that’s very close to Los Angeles. Just like many teenagers out there, they thought it would be cool to explore a dark tunnel in which a lot of trains pass by. It all seemed  good and safe, and it seemed like they were going to be able to make it to the other side of the tunnel without a problem. Unfortunately, when they least expected it, a train was coming their way. They had to run for their lives and get out of the tunnel before being smashed by the huge machine. Luckily, they made it out alive, and they had a gopro that recorded the whole thing. The footage is certainly better than any action movie out there. These are real people that were close to losing their lives. The good thing is that they survived, and the video did not end in tragedy.\n\n\nExploring a Haunted House \n(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kvfkWm4n-U number 12)\n\nI’m not sure how many of you are into this, but if you like exploring haunted houses, make sure you bring a gopro when you go in! Like this group of teenagers, who decided to explore a haunted house and see what was inside. As soon as you see the footage, you can see that the house has a very disturbing look. I mean, what else can you expect from a haunted house, right? Now, the creepiest part about this footage comes around the 5:53 minute mark in which we can see some sort of shadow lurking in the background. Is it a ghost?",

        "description": "10 Aliens Caught on Camera in Real Life\n\nAre we alone in this universe? That is a question that has troubled many people for decades. But if these\nvideos are to be believed, then we already have the answer we are looking for. Today, we will be looking\nat aliens captured on tape. Number one is the most compelling so watch out for it.\n\n10. I’m Ready for My Close Up\nhttps://www.charlotteobserver.com/latest-\nnews/kyoqff/picture231675703/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/20190618_092111_fitted.png\nNorth Carolina’s Candid Critters is a group of people who set motion activated cameras all over North\nCarolina with the purpose of capturing the local wildlife in their natural habitat. They regularly post their\nfindings in social media, mostly of them are of easily identifiable local fauna just going about their\nbusiness. They aren’t in the habit of posting unexplained or mysterious content, but one of their photos\nsparked up quite a controversy. Just look at the photo and you’ll see what I mean.\nThis photo was taken on March 2 nd 2019 in some undisclosed woods in North Carolina and was posted\nonline with the tagline “Critter Quiz Time, what species can be seen in the photo below?” The photo\nshows a haunting close up of a creature in the dark with hollow black eyes appearing to peek curiously\ninto the camera.\nMany commenters quickly pointed out that it looked like the famous gray alien, with its dark bulging yes\nand pale complexion. Although Candid Creatures did say that the photo was of a curious housecat, they\nnever elaborated on how they came up with that conclusion.\nSo, is this a photo of an oddly curious gray alien? What do you think.\n\nNumber 9. The Alien of Red Gate\nhttps://www.carbontv.com/shows/outdoor-weekly/seasons/2019/clips/47/?jwsource=cl\nRed Gate is an area in Western Montana that has been reported to be a hotbed for paranormal activity.\nFor the past 50 to 60 years, sightings of weird lights, UFOs, and even unexplained humanoids have been\nreported in the area. However, all of these tails are based on eyewitness accounts without really any\nhard evidence to back it up; until now.\nDon Bromley, a ranch foreman in Western Montana, had a habit of setting up hundreds of trail cams in\nthe property where he works, mainly to catch photo of the local wildlife, and sometimes even\ntrespassers into the property. But one day, he captured three night photos that baffled him.\nThe first photo showed the blurry image of a humanoid figure with distinct legs, undefinable arms, and\nan oddly large head. The next two photos were pitch black, which was odd because the trail camera was\nworking fine. Did the figure in the first photo cause the camera to malfunction?\nDid we just see evidence of the paranormal activity on Red Gate? Is it an alien? Let us know what you\nthink.\n\nNumber 8. The Texas UFO\nhttps://youtu.be/ldE74AC_JY4\nUFOs have been spotted in the skies of Texas for decades. This next clip is just one of the latest.\nSecureteam10, a YouTube channel with more than 350,000 subscribers, has published a new UFO\nsighting out of Texas. The footage of the Texas UFO is actually pretty clear. The Texas UFO was saucer\nshaped. And apparently changed speeds, according to the man who shot the footage. Interestingly, the\nTexas man is not a big UFO believer. But he noted that there are too many unexplained things out there.\nThis is a common theme with many people regarding aliens.\nWhat’s shocking about this video is the fact that the man filming the object was very much a skeptic, but\nthe event was so compelling it was enough for him to suspend his disbelief.\nDid this man film an actual UFO? You decide.\n\nNumber 7. The Dead Alien\nhttps://youtu.be/n16Iwgzm0Nw\nThis video has been on the internet for more than a decade now, but it still sparks an animated\ndiscussion. The footage was taken near the village of Kamensk in the Russian republic Buryatia, just\nnorth of Lake Baikal. It showed what appeared to be a humanoid body less than a meter high with a\nskeletal big-eyed head and thin naked body. One of its legs was missing. Off-screen comments said the\nbody was found a couple of hours before and was clearly very dead.\nThe local media reported there were numerous reports of UFO sightings in the area in March, some of\nthem later attributed to bombing training at a nearby military range.\n\nIf you're new, Subscribe! → http://goo.gl/djmfuX\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Top5BestShow\n\nTop 5 Best is the #1 place for all your heart warming stories about amazing people that will inspire you everyday.

Make sure to subscribe and never miss a single video!\n\n#viral #amazing #FactFile #animals\n\n\nOver the years, Google Maps has become one of the best navigation apps in the world. You can plan road trips, source for better routes in traffic, or view virtually everywhere on earth within a few taps on your smartphone or computer.\n\nHowever, there are some things you just can't expect to find while using or playing around with Google Maps like viewing the historic 9/11 attacks or perhaps finding a long-lost monster that can devour you in a heartbeat. \n\nThat's why today,  we bring you the list of ten mysterious deep-sea creatures spotted on Google earth. Some of the animals on this list might sound too good to be accurate, but someone actually saw them. If you want to find out what those are,  you better stay tuned. After all,  scientists explored only 3 percent of our oceans with many more to unravel. Let's have a look,  shall we? \n\nNumber 10: The Giant Spider in Mexico \n\nDo you remember the fictional Aragog from Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secret?  Well, it appears that he might be real after all, as a YouTube video maker going by the name MexicoGeek claimed to find a giant spider on an island off the coast of Mexico. \n\nAt first, the oddly shaped object looking like an arthropod doesn't appear to him as anything cryptic, until he discovered its actual size to be about the size of a bus using Google ruler. And with that size, such a creature is large enough to devour a human. Blimey!\n  \nHowever, many claimed it a hoax since the exact coordinates on Google maps are not available for other users to view it. Some experts even believed that it was probably a build-up of algae, appearing at such distance from the satellite as an arachnid - a phenomenon called Pareidolia when we interpret shapes based on imagination.\n\nNevertheless, the picture surely looked real, and whether the image is a hoax or not is still a mystery that is yet to be solved. \n\nGoogle Earth Takes A Photo Of A Giant Spider\n\nNumber 9: The Crabzilla in British Water. \n\nWinter Quinton, the owner of the Weird Whitstable blog, posted a Google map screenshot of one of his followers that showed a shrimp-like creature measuring about fifty feet on the actual scale off the coast of Whitstable harbor in Britain. Is this possible?\n\nWhistable is a prominent oyster palace, and we've always known crabs to be fascinating creatures owing to their very many species with some small and others very large, like the Japanese spider crab, which holds the gold medal of about 12 feet. \n\nHowever, a crab such as the Winter's crabzilla, which is about three times the size of a double-decker bus is quite unfathomable. That's why many marine biologists described it as a well-made put-on, or perhaps some sort of weird-looking shoal owing to the currents in the area.\n\nWell, whether it is a sandbank or a crab, something truly lies down there, and Google Maps has it. We can only hope that it is not a man-eating \"crabzilla\" as the source claims it to be, as that might scare our wits out. \n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.express.co.uk/news/weird/521553/Giant-crab-spotted-off-British-coast/amp\n\nNumber 8:  The Loch Ness Monster \n \nNessie, or so it has been nicknamed, has always been the talk of the town in Scotland. This creature, which supposedly looks like a serpent or a plesiosaur, has been reported several times in many parts, especially at Loch Ness lake. Although, many experts have debunked its existence over the years owing to lack of concrete evidence.\n\nBut as it stands, it seems the mystery has begun to gain more grounds with the sighting of Nessie on google Maps by Lisa Stout, a 31-year old mom based in the US. \n\nLisa has always fiddled with her phone with the hope of finding Nessie, and she supposedly hit the jackpot one morning after dropping her child off at school with the sight of an elusive creature with long necks sticking out of the lake on Google Street View around Loch Ness. \n\nIs that truly Nessie? Has the long search for Nessie finally ended? This mage has attracted a lot of shockwaves on the internet if indeed Nessie has been found. What do you guys think?\n\n\nNumber 7: The Megalodon\n\nMegalodons are the species of massive killer sharks that are considered to be the most abundant species of sharks growing to a length of about 60 feet. That's about three African elephants placed side by side. Blimey! That's large. One more thing to add to their profile is that they lived about 23 million years ago. \n\nHowever, it seems they are not extinct after all when a group of scientists from the University of British Columbia who were investigating the Persian Gulf discovered",

        "description": "10 Dinosaurs Caught on Camera in Real Life\n\r\nIf you're new, Subscribe! → http://goo.gl/djmfuX\r\n\r\nFact File is the #1 place for all your heart warming stories about amazing people that will inspire you everyday. Make sure to subscribe and never miss a single video!\r\n\r\n#viral #amazing #FactFile #animals\n\n\nThe existence of dinosaurs has long intrigued the world of science as they were once the most successful species on the planet. Dinosaurs had lived their time and were wiped from the surface of the earth by asteroid bombs worth billions of Hiroshima. Who knows what they did wrong to have met with such a fatal end. \n\nScientists believe that not one dinosaur could have survived the apocalypse millions of years ago. And we have their fossil to tell us their story. However, recent evidence has popped up to foil that notion, and a lot of questions have ensued from it. What if the surviving dinosaurs only got better at hiding when humans came around?\n\nCould it be that they are afraid of our capabilities because we are smarter? Well, you are about to find out as we present ten of the dinosaurs caught on camera in real life. Do well to stay tuned to the end. They might just clear your doubts. \n\nNumber 10:  Velociraptor Caught in the Woods. \n\nYou can't start a list of dinosaurs and skip cool ones like t-rexes and velociraptors. Not with the significant roles they played in Jurassic Park. But, it seems that these vicious monsters managed to survive a mass extinction. And the films may not be the only place you get to see them. \n\nThough the source of this video is unknown, it does claim to show a velociraptor escaping into the woods. It's quite blurry at first, but when you zoom in, you'll surely see the magic. It's so unbelievable because we can't rationalize how a raptor survived for so long in that sparse bush. This plus many other questions have stirred lots of reactions among critics online. \n\nWhile some say that the creature came from the forest nearby where it fed on small unfortunate animals. Others are more skeptical, claiming that video could have been the work of a smart editor—one who may probably be playing on our intelligence or perhaps trying to garner more views. \n\nWell, if that's the case, we say \"hats off\" to the mastermind behind this video. Indeed, he has won the hearts of a million believers and doubters alike. The clip looks pretty real and convincing. \n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.pinterest.com/amp/pin/448882287852634592/\n\n\nNumber 9: The Ohio Pterosaur\n\nFrom the enigma of the wow signal to the reincarnation of one of its inhabitants, far too many things are complicated to explain in Ohio. This footage about a dinosaur in the sky is just another on the list. \n\nWhen you look at the video, you'd see a bird flying. Soaring in all its majesty to entice any ordinary onlooker. We guess that's one of the first attractions which compelled the maker of this clip to document the scenery in the first place.\n\nUnfortunately, that bird is no ordinary one. We believe you know that already. At the very least, the bigness and the claws on the wings would have given it away. So, you should be thinking about a massive bat, shouldn't you?\n\nHowever, it can't be a bat, not without that pentadactyl. Even if it did, how do you explain the crest on its head? Only the pterosaurs are known with such characteristics. But they went extinct 66 million years ago, or that's what we believe. What if they never left? Well, we leave that to you. \n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3225044/amp/Special-effects-return-Pterosaur-Amateur-footage-appears-capture-extinct-flying-reptile-surveying-sky-Ohio.html\n\nNumber 8: The Mokele-Mbembe\n\nAt some point, you must have wondered the possibility of a myth becoming true someday. Just take brief research into Ogopogo and the legend of the Leviathan. You'll see that they all have a basis on something in reality. \n\nLook at the Kraken, for example. The existence of a giant squid inspired it. The Mokele-Mbembe is no different. But the good news, we have its basis caught on camera!\n\nInitially hard to find, this picture, which looks out of focus, is one of the very few you can trace to the profile of the Mokele-mbembe. That monster with a long whippy neck endowed with a weight at least twice that of a hippopotamus. If the details are accurate, the Mokele-mbembe must surely be a dinosaur. Perhaps, a kind of sauropod in the family of dinosaurs with four legs. \n\nBelieved to inhabit the Congo basin, the Mokele is a swimmer that lives in caves and a killer that eats leaves. Yes, we know. A few blurry portrayals and videos of testament is not enough to convince the science world. If this turns out to be real, then what next?",

But, as history has proven, there is a basis for which these\ncreatures were thought up. Today, we will be looking at 10 mythical creatures that actually existed.\nNumber one will make you question whether middle earth was real or not so stay tuned for that.\n\nNumber 10. The Dire Wolf\nDire Wolves became widely popular when Game of Thrones hit the mainstream. These large wolves are\na constant companion of the Starks in the show, and are shown to be large, intelligent, and protective\ncreatures. They aren’t, however, merely just a figment of George RR Martin’s imagination. They are in\nfact, based on real animals.\nDire wolves lived during the Pleistocene, between 250,000 to roughly 10,000 years ago. Unfortunately,\nreal dire wolves were not really the size of ponies. They were larger than modern wolves, though, and\ncould weigh as much as 200 pounds — almost twice what a very large modern wolf might weigh.\nTheir skulls are much larger compared to today’s modern wolves. Ironically though, their brains are\nmuch smaller. However, if they had bigger brains, we probably wouldn’t have had amazing fossils of\nthem. Thousands of dire wolf fossils have been found in the La Brea tar pits. Scientists believe that they\nwere trapped there when they started feeding on the carcasses of other animals trapped in the tar.\n\nNumber 9. The Unicorn\nPerhaps the earliest account of unicorns is by well-known Greek historian, Ctesias, who described a large\nanimal with a horn on its forehead in India. It’s quite possible that he saw a rhino from a distance and\nthought it was a horse with horn on its head. But fossils unearthed in Siberia may have proven the\nexistence of this mythical creature.\nCalled the Siberian unicorn, it was 1.8 meters tall, over 4 meters long and weighed more than 4 tons. It\nwas covered in a shaggy coat and earned its nickname from the huge horn that grew out of its forehead.\nYes, it doesn’t quite resemble the classic unicorn of lore but so far, this is the closest that we can get to a\nreal one.\nThey were believed to have died out 350,000 years ago, but a discovery of a fossil in Kazakhstan\nchanged all that. Carbon dating test revealed the fossil to be only 29,000 years old. This means that the\nanimal roamed the earth 321,000 years longer than previously thought.\n\nNumber 8. The Komodo Dragon\nBelieve it or not, the Komodo Dragon was considered a mythical creature all the way up to 1910 when it\nwas first discovered. Prior to that, rumors were spreading that eight-foot-long, hundred pound\nprehistoric lizards were living on a remote Indonesian island.\n\nWanting to prove or disprove the existence of these creatures himself, Dutch colonial official Lt. Steyn\nvan Hensbroek put together an expedition to Komodo Island. He was able to catch and kill a six-foot\nspecimen, and he sent the carcass as proof to the Zoological Museum and Botanical Garden at Bogor,\nJava.\nSeemingly not satisfied with the discovery, American explorer W. Douglas Burden decided to put\ntogether an expedition himself, making up his mind to catch live specimens. In the end the expedition\nwas able to pile several dead and two live Komodo dragons onto their steamer and return to New York\nCity, giving scientists plenty to study and visitors of the Bronx Zoo plenty to see.\n\nNumber 7. The Bunyip\nThe bunyip is a little like Australia&#39;s Loch Ness monster in that it lives in the water and has never been\nphotographed despite the fact that hundreds of people have seen it. But the legend might have actually\nhad rational origins.\nThe bunyip is an Aboriginal legend — according to Australian History, the name means &quot;devil&quot; or &quot;spirit&quot;\nand the creature is said to look like a cross between a crocodile and a horse, though accounts differ.\nBunyips stalk and kill human beings and supposedly make an eerie sound like a &quot;hollow boom,&quot; which\ncertainly seems terrifying if you&#39;ve never been around any shotguns or farm equipment.",

        "description": "These Things Are Not Supposed To Exist But We Have Seen Them\n\nWe think we understand the orld, but there comes a time when something comes along that defines all\nlogic. Today, we will be looking at some weird animals that shouldn’t really exist, but defy logic by\nexisting. Do you think you’re safe swimming in lakes and rivers? Stay tuned for number one to find out\nthat you’re gravely mistaken.\n\nFreshwater Seals\nWe normally associate seals with saltwater, but there is a species of seal that live exclusively in fresh\nwater. Known locally as the Nerpa and possibly half a million years old as a species, the Baikal Seal is the\nonly true entirely freshwater seal species on the planet, restricted to the deep and mysterious Lake\nBaikal, which is in fact the deepest lake on Earth. These aquatic carnivores are a species of uncertain\norigin, still presenting a mystery to biologists who have yet to precisely pin down the circumstances\nleading up to their establishment in the lake as an endemic species.\nLake Baikal is not only extraordinarily deep, it is also extremely cold, with ice that remains into the\nspring breeding season. Well adapted to their environment, female Baikal Seals have developed the\nability to create ice dens, in which they take shelter and subsequently give birth, usually to one pup. A\nsmall seal, the Baikal Seal may reach just past 4.5 feet in length and weigh no more than 154 pounds in\nmost cases. The gray colored, docile lake seals maintain breathing holes in the ice and haul out along\nrocky shorelines in warmer weather.\n\nLizards in the Ocean\nPeople often relate lizards to desserts, or sometimes on a rocky outcrop or a fallen tree in a jungle\nsomewhere, but them and the ocean just isn’t clicking. Yet, a member of this vast and diverse group of\nsmall dinosaur lookalikes has done the unimaginable and become marine, basking on wave splashed\nrocks and foraging under the surf. Native to the Galapagos Islands and surrounding waters, the large and\ncolorful Marine Iguana is a lizard that has mastered the sea, hauling out on rocks like a sea lion in\nbetween dives below the waves, where they forage on marine algae and seaweeds chewed off the\nsurface of submerged rocks.\nTheir plant-based diet is easily harvested with the help of the iguana’s razor like teeth. Measuring over 3\nfeet in length and weighing up to 22 pounds, the Marine Iguana is the only ocean-going lizard on the\nplanet. Large groups of breeding females jockey for space in the breeding season, while males fight\nfiercely for a chance to mate with the female of their choice. The dinosaur-like creatures are normally\nblackish or greyish in color, but the males stand out with its greenish and reddish hues that come into\ncolor during the breeding season, signaling dominance and urging females to select them as mates.\n\nPoisonous Birds\nWhen one thinks of poisonous animals, our minds immediately go to various reptiles like snakes, or even\namphibians like poison dart frogs, and sometimes even mammals like the platypus, but never in our lives\n\nwould we think that there are poisonous birds. But the fact is, there are. The different species of Pitohui\nfrom New Guinea are toxic feathered beauties from the rainforest, to be approached with great care.\nNative to the rainforest environments of New Guinea, the Hooded Pitohui is correctly termed as a\npoisonous species as a highly dangerous batrachotoxin is present throughout the bird’s feathers, skin\nand flesh. The bird’s toxicity became apparent in 1989 when a California Academy of Sciences based\nresearcher named Jack Dumbacher who had set out to study birds of paradise in Papua New Guinea\nnoticed burning pain in his hands when scratched by the peculiar Pitohuis caught in nets originally\nintended to catch birds of paradise for closer inspection.\nThe toxins that make up the chemical arsenal of these birds are in fact the same lethal compounds\nfound in poison dart frogs notorious for being capable of killing predators and humans alike. Exactly why\nthe birds possess this toxicity remains a matter of scientific interest, with associated speculation that the\nbright colors of these birds warns potential predators of their chemical laden bodies. \n\nIf you're new, Subscribe! → http://goo.gl/djmfuX\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Top5BestShow\n\nTop 5 Best is the #1 place for all your heart warming stories about amazing people that will inspire you everyday.

Well, these footages just might change your mind, especially when the\nfootage is accompanied by a miracle, just like number one so stay tuned for that. Here are 10 angels\ncaught on camera.\n\nNumber 10. Angel on the Football Field\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQzuOIXqiSg\nOn November 7, 2009, Doug Luaders was set to coach a JCYA youth football game in Fenton, Missouri.\nThat very same day, a photo was taken on the field showing two smiling boys celebrating their win. But\nthe disposable camera also seemed to capture a white shadowy figure floating right alongside the\nbeaming boys.\nWhen Doug saw the photo, he was completely blown away. You see, Doug’s 20-year-old son was\nsupposed to be his assistant coach that day. But on his way to the game, Kyle passed away in a horrible\ncar crash after his vehicle collided with a semi-truck. The mysterious photo became public. Doug, and\nmany others in their community and beyond, believe the white angelic figure was Kyle, who was on his\nway to the very football field where the picture was taken.\nI hate being cynical, and I’m happy that Doug found a certain level of solace on the photo, especially for\nwhat happened to his son. But then again, is it just me or does the “angel” look more like a blurred\nextreme close up of a mosquito? Believe whatever you want to believe I guess.\n\nNumber 9. In-flight Angel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bK_cpftcrI\nSeven-year-old AAsher Lisles dreams of being a famous photographer. Every time he sees his mom\nholding her phone, he immediately takes it and starts taking photos. He takes some great photos, mostly\nof random things. But one photo he took while on a plane ride home from Washington may just make\nhis dreams come true.\nAAsher, who was born with Down Syndrome hence the two uppercase A’s on his name which, according\nto his mom, represents the extra chromosome, which is quite clever I must say, was with his mom on\nthe plane ride home from visiting his older brother. There was a lot of turbulence at the time, during\nwhich AAsher asked for his mom’s phone and started taking pictures.\nWhen Kerri, AAsher’s mom, got her phone back, she started going through the photos her son took,\neven deleting some of them. But when she got to this particular photo, she was dumbfounded.\nHonestly, it took me off guard as well so I’d rather you just look at it for yourself than describe it.\nKerri thinks it’s Asher’s guardian angel looking after him while in flight. But what do you think?\nComment down below.\n\nNumber 8. Angel in Ghana\n\n\nDo you believe everything you see in the news? If your answer is yes, then this next news clip will\ndefinitely make you believe in angels.\nA Ghanaian News Channel reported on a strange sighting in Dansoman, Ghana. In a segment called “an\nencounter with the dead”, a man was telling a story of a very strange event that happened to him. He\nsaid that he saw, and was able to film, a strange flying creature frolicking in the clouds above him. This\ncreature, which he believes to be an angel, can be seen flying in and out of the dark clouds, as if playing.\nAgain, of course, the footage is very grainy and the flying creature could be anything. It could even be a\nhoax for all we know. But then again, if the story was good enough for Ghana’s national TV, then there\njust might be something to this very strange sighting\n\nNumber 7. The Mosque Angel\n\nMost people think that angels only exist in Christian religions. But the fact is, they appear in the stories\nof many religions around the world. Angels play a major role in Islamic religions. According to their\nreligion Allah sends the angels to every Mosque to shower his blessings on the people. Islamic belief in\nangels is so prevalent that any paranormal activity seen in mosques are almost always attributed to\nangels of Allah. This clip is no exception.\nMuslims offering prayers at a Mosque in Azerbaijan were surprised by what they described as an ‘Angel\nGhost’ offering prayers. Some were convinced that it was an angel and others believed it to be a ghost.\nThey preferred the Angel approach as it appeared to be praying, and they believe that a ghost cannot\noffer prayers but an angel can.\nThe video was shot using a phone, hence its grainy quality, making others think that the so-called angel\nmay be a trick of the light. But then again, if said video strengthens someone’s faith and its effect os\noverall positive, it doesn’t really matter if it’s real or not, does it?",

However I can go on rollercoasters as much as I want and it&#39;s actually the slow tick and pulling up of the ride that gives me more fear and anxiety rather than the actual drop. The anticipation. I think my mom instilled that fear into me due to the fact I went on the same ride! Tower of terror, and my mom squeezed my hand so hard and screamed so loudly that it implanted that fear into my brain.",
